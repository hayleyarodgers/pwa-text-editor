## Description

My goal for this project was to build a text editor that meets PWA criteria. This single page application can run in the browser and offline.

### User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.
```

### Tools and Technologies Used

To create this application, I used used:
- IndexedDB and idb as a database
- Webpack to bundle front-end code
- Workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets
- And, Heroku.
